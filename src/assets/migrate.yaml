        **Hibernate 6 - Queries and persistence.xml**

        Open your persistence.xml file:

        1. Ensure that no property still uses the javax. namespace - otherwise change this to Jakarta.
        2. Remove the `hibernate.dialect` property. The new version works better with autodetection.
        3. When using non jpa-compliant, hibernate specific (HQL) features, you can set `hibernate.jpa.compliance.query` to `false` to restore the old behavior of lenient validation.
        4. Native queries that formerly returned `BigInteger` will now return `Long` objects
        5. Native queries that formerly returned `Timestamp` java objects for `Timestamp with Timezone` columns might return `Instant` now.
           However, in most cases IOM uses `Timestamp without Timezone`. Specific database functions that return 
           timezone information (like `now()`) can be cast to `::timestamp` to restore the old behavior.
        6. Intershop recommends to test all code involving custom entities and queries due to the numerous changes in Hibernate 6.x.
