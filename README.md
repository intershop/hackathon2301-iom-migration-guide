# AngularUpgradeGuide

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

The application lives in a single `AppComponent` and loads recommendations from `recommendations.ts`.

## Preconditions

- install node.js:
  - via chocolatey: `choco install nodejs` 
  - or download from the website: 
- install angular-cli and yarn via npm: `npm install -g @angular/cli yarn` (via administrator prompt)
- download dependencies via `yarn install`
- you can now start a local development server (continue below)

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
